# Python_spelling_bee
Spelling bee contest preparation. 

A csv file from an url link has been used as a data source for a Python dicionary. The user is prompted to write the translation of a word. Afterwards this input is compared 
with the correct value from the dictionary. The user has 3 tries. If they input a correct word one point has been awarded. The user is asked if they want to replay the game.
When they input a value different than "yes" the game is terminated.
